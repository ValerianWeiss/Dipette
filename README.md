# Dipette ðŸ’‰
Dipette is a Windows desktop Application which can select colors of your screen. Afterwards you can copy the RGB, HEX or CMYK values via button click.

The Project is build with electron, react and a C# executable. Electron is wrapping the react app. React is communicating with the C# executable which sends the color values of the screen to the frontend.

## How to build
To build you need the `csc` compiler to complile the C# module. You also have to place the Newtonsoft.Json in the `Dipette/src/ScreenChecker/libs` folder. If this is done you can run:
```bash
run npm insall
npm run electron-pack
```
It is also possible to run the scripts with yarn.
The App will be build to the `Dipette/dist/win-unpacked` folder.

## How to download
To test and the app you can download it [here](https://github.com/ValerianWeiss/Dipette/releases "releases"), unpack the zip and run the Dipette.exe.

> #### Note:
> The `setup.exe` is not working at the moment because it does not contain the C# executable at the moment.
